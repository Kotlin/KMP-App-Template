 * Using a sealed class/interface for screens with Voyager isn't strictly necessary
 * as Voyager uses `Screen` objects directly. However, this can be useful for
 * organizing screen types or for routing logic if you build on top of Voyager.
 *
 * For now, we'll just use Voyager's `Screen` interface directly for simplicity in screen definitions.
 * We can create specific Screen objects later.
 *
 * Let's define some placeholder screen objects for now to illustrate navigation.

// Example of how you might define screens with Voyager:
// object LoginScreen : Screen { ... }
// data class HomeScreen(val userId: String) : Screen { ... }

// We will define actual screens in their respective feature modules/packages later.
// For now, this file is a placeholder for navigation-related sealed classes or common interfaces
// if we decide we need them beyond what Voyager provides.

// Let's create a simple theme file first, as it's referenced by components.
// Then we'll update App.kt to use Voyager's Navigator.

// No specific code here for now, actual screens will be defined in their feature directories.
// This file can be used later for shared navigation logic or screen markers if needed.
// For example, we could define a common interface like:
// interface NavScreen : Screen {
//    val title: String // Example shared property
// }
// For now, this is just a placeholder.
// The primary setup for Voyager will be in App.kt.

// Let's define a basic theme file first.
// Then we'll update App.kt to use Voyager.
// Then we'll define a LoginScreen as the initial screen.

// Create a Theme.kt
// Create a LoginScreen.kt
// Update App.kt to use Navigator and show LoginScreen
